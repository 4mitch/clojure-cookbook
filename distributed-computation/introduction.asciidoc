=== Introduction

With the advent of cheaper and cheaper storage, we're inclined to
store more and more data. As this data grows larger and larger it
becomes increasingly difficult to utilize to its full potential. To
this end, numerous new techniques have emerged in the last decade or
so for dealing with such quantities of data.

The primary focus of this chapter is one such technique,
http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html[MapReduce],
developed at Google in the early 2000s. Functional even in name, this
technique uses map and reduce in parallel across multiple machines at
tremendous scale to process data at phenomenal speed. In this chapter
we'll be covering http://cascalog.org/[Cascalog], a data processing
library built on top of Hadoop (an open source MapReduce
implementation).

We'll also briefly cover http://storm-project.net/[Storm], a
real-time, stream-processing library in use at several tech giants
such as Twitter, Groupon and Yahoo!.

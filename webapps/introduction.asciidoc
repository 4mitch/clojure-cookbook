=== Introduction

Web application development is the bread-winner for many languages
nowadays; Clojure is no exception to this. In the
http://cemerick.com/2013/11/18/results-of-the-2013-state-of-clojure-clojurescript-survey/[2013
State of Clojure Survery] "Web Development" ranked first for the
question: "In which domains are you applying Clojure and/or
ClojureScript?"

Much of the Clojure web development community today centers around
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring], a library very much akin
to Ruby's http://rack.github.io/[Rack]. Starting with the introduction
to Ring in <<sec_webapps_ring_introduction>> you'll find a full
complement of recipes that will get you up to speed in no time.

Following Ring, the chapter takes a tour about the Clojure web
development ecosystem of 2013, covering a few
templating/HTML-manipulation libraries and a number of alternative web
frameworks.

==== Making a Window

// By John Walker

==== Problem

You want to make a window with trivial content.

==== Solution

Use the +seesaw+ to create a frame.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns example.seesaw
    (:require [seesaw :refer [frame native! pack! show!]]))

(native!)

----

(frame :title "Jackson" :content "I can't believe it's not Michael!")
;; -> 

()
----

==== Discussion
+Seesaw+ is an extremely powerful library built on top of +Swing+. Note that +frame+ returns a +JFrame+, and that +config!+, +pack!+ and +show!+ all operate on its result. This implies that +Seesaw+ functions are able to operate on other +Swing+ interfaces, meaning that you can easily use window builders with +Seesaw+.

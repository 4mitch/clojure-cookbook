==== Read property files

// By Tobias Bayer (codebrickie)

===== Problem

You need to read property files and access their key value pairs.

===== Solution

Propertea is a library that offers simple access to property files.

Include Properta as a dependency for your project.

[source,clojure]
----
(defproject fruitcolors "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[propertea "1.2.3"]])
----

Read the property file and access its key-value pairs.

[source,clojure]
----
(use '[propertea.core])

(def props (read-properties "fruitcolors.properties"))

(props :banana)
;; -> "yellow"

(props :grannysmith)
;; -> "green"
----

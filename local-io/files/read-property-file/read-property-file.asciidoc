// By Tobias Bayer (codebrickie)

You need to a read property file and access its key-value pairs.

Propertea is a library that offers simple access to property files.

Include propertea as a dependency for your project.

(defproject fruitcolors "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[propertea "1.2.3"]])
----

Read the property file and access its key-value pairs.

[source,clojure]

(use '[propertea.core])

(def props (read-properties "fruitcolors.properties"))

(props :banana)

////

===== Problem

You want to write to stdout and stderr.

===== Solution

To stdout,

[source,clojure]
----
(println "Print line to stdout")
----

To stderr,

[source,clojure]
----
(binding [*out* *err*]
  (println "Print line to stderr"))
----

===== Discussion

In Clojure +*in*+, +*out*+, and +*err*+ are bound to stdin, stdout, and stderr.
Using the +binding+ command all output normally sent to stdout can be sent to
stderr; or using +clojure.java.io/writer+, to the file of your choice.
